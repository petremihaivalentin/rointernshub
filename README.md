# Introduction
A collection of common Microsoft internal portals, useful for interns in Romania. 
Original site hosted on Azure and published to https://aka.ms/mssites. Not available without CorpNet connection.
The site runs on node.js, using the Express framework and Pug for templating. 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended editor. 
To run, just navigate to the folder, run `npm install` and `npm run`. The site should be reachable at http://localhost:3000.

Huge thanks to MSSites Team at Microsoft for allowing an intern to develop a site based on their code.
